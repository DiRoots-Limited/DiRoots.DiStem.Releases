## Sort the plugins

You can organize the plugins in the sequence in which you use each plugin the most. In this way, the sequence you define can help you access the tools you need more quickly.

## Collapse and Expand window

DiStem plugins allow you to work with Revit while keeping the plugin window open, but you can get more space to work with Revit. All you have to do is double-clik on the window header to Collapse and Expand it.

## Resize Window

Mouse over the edges of the window and click and drag to extend or reduce the window. Note that, there is a limit to how much you can reduce the window, to ensure that all the information in the window is displayed.

## Select multiple rows

DiStem plugins have a great advantage for making bulk actions and saving time. To make this task simpler, you don't need to select row per row, just select one and press the Shift button in your keyboard and then select the last row. Now you have several rows selected to perform the batch actions.
